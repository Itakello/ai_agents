Extract structured job posting metadata from this page in JSON format.

Extract the following fields:
{{FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS}}

## RULES
* Be strictly factual – no inference beyond the page content.
* Do not abbreviate numerical ranges ("€80 000 – €90 000" ➜ keep the full string).
* Never invent data; if unsure, return `null`.
* For array fields, return an array of strings.
* For date fields, use YYYY-MM-DD format.
* When extracting arrays (languages, tools, libraries, locations, benefits, …) - look at bullet and numbered lists, comma-separated phrases, and ad-hoc mentions anywhere else.
* Canonicalise obvious synonyms (e.g. "Node.js" = "Node", "PostgreSQL" = "Postgres").
* Deduplicate each array, preserving case & spelling as in the posting.

Return only a valid JSON object with these fields. Use null for missing information.
