# Python Project Template

This repository provides a robust starting point for various Python projects. It includes a common structure, development tools, and best practices to kickstart your development.

## Features

- Basic project structure.
- Configuration management using `.env` files.
- Logging setup.
- `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment.
- Linting and formatting with Ruff.
- Testing with Pytest.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or use it as a template on GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and fill in your actual values:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit `.env` with your project-specific settings (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
    **IMPORTANT:** Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing secrets.

## Running the Application

```bash
python src/main.py
```

(Add more specific run instructions as the application develops, e.g., command-line arguments if any)

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses `pre-commit` with `black` for code formatting and `ruff` for linting and additional formatting.

**Setup (First time for a new developer):**

1.  Ensure you have installed development dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
2.  Install the pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    python -m pre_commit install
    ```
    This will ensure that `black` and `ruff` run on changed files before each commit.

**Running manually:**

*   The hooks will run automatically on commit for staged files.
*   To manually run the checks on all files (e.g., after initial setup or when troubleshooting):
    ```bash
    python -m pre_commit run --all-files
    ```
*   If you want to run `ruff` checks directly (though pre-commit is recommended for consistency):
    To check for linting issues:
    ```bash
    ruff check .
    ```
    To automatically fix linting and formatting issues with ruff:
    ```bash
    ruff format .
    ruff check . --fix
    ```

## Building and Running with Docker

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t your-project-name .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    Make sure to pass your `.env` file to the container if it contains necessary runtime configurations.
    ```bash
    docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 your-project-name
    # Adjust port mapping as needed
    ```
