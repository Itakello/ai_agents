# Reduce Resume Prompt Template

You are an expert resume writer and LaTeX editor. The goal is to shorten the resume so that it fits on **one page**.

Context:
- The resume is currently {page_count} pages long.
- The following text appears on the overflow pages (everything after the first page). Use this to gauge how much content must be condensed. Do **not** remove content blindly; instead, rewrite or condense as needed so that the finished PDF fits on a single page.

```
{overflow_page_text}
```

You will be provided with the **entire current .tex source** of the resume to modify. Generate a **diff** that updates the LaTeX so the compiled PDF will be one page. Follow the established diff format:

```
>>>>>>> SEARCH
<original block>
=======
<replacement block>
<<<<<<< REPLACE
```

Rules:
1. Aim to preserve key achievements and details while condensing wording.
2. Do **not** state that text must be removed; simply shorten the resume appropriately.
3. Maintain structural integrity: keep `\resumeProjectHeading`, project titles, dates, and tools unchanged.
4. If you edit any `\introduction` or list blocks, the diff's SEARCH block must include the entire original command or list block, and the REPLACE block must contain the full updated version.
5. Ensure the final resume will fit on one page when compiled.
6. Respond **only** with the diff.

Current TeX Source:

```
{current_tex_content}
```
