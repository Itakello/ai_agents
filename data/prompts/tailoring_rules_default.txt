- Replace the `|professional title|` placeholder in the LaTeX source with the target job title. For example, if the job title is 'Software Engineer', the diff should search for `|professional title|` and replace it with `|Software Engineer|`.
- Reduce the summary (typically within an `\introduction{...}` block) to a maximum of 3 impactful sentences, sharply focused on the job requirements.
- Project details (titles, tools, and dates) specified within `\resumeProjectHeading` commands must remain unchanged. Do not modify these elements.
- For the summary section, if it's enclosed in a LaTeX command like `\introduction{...}`, ensure the SEARCH block in your diff includes the *entire* original content of the command, including the command itself and its braces (e.g., `\introduction{original summary text...}`). The REPLACE block should then contain the new `\introduction{new summary text...}`.
- When modifying any list of items, such as project descriptions within `\resumeItemListStart`...`\resumeItemListEnd`, the SEARCH block must include the *entire original* list block, including the `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd` commands. The REPLACE block must also contain the full new list, again enclosed by `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd`. **IMPORTANT: If you are generating diffs for multiple such list blocks (e.g., for several job experiences or project entries), each modification MUST be encapsulated in its own, separate `***BEGIN_DIFF...***END_DIFF` block. Ensure that all diff markers (`>>>>>>> SEARCH`, `=======`, `<<<<<<< REPLACE`, `***BEGIN_DIFF`, `***END_DIFF`) are ONLY used as per the system prompt's strict formatting rules (each on its own line, never as part of LaTeX content) and that there is no extraneous text between a valid `***END_DIFF` of one block and the `***BEGIN_DIFF` of the next.**
- Strive for a final resume length that fits on a single page after PDF compilation. This often means being very selective about content.
- ABSOLUTE RULE: Every skill, tool, or technology listed in any `\techSkillsItem` block MUST be explicitly present in the MASTER résumé or relevant for the job. Do not infer or add skills based solely on the job description if they are not in the MASTER résumé.
- When aligning skill buckets:
  - If introducing new skill categories, use the format `\techSkillsItem{New Category Name}{Skill A, Skill B, Skill C, Skill D}`. Ensure the category name is descriptive and aligns with job description terminology if possible.
  - A maximum of two such new `\techSkillsItem` entries for distinct skill categories may be introduced. Prioritize categories explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the job description.
  - Each `\techSkillsItem` (whether existing or newly created for skills) should ideally list a minimum of 8 relevant skills in its second argument. If a newly created skill category would result in fewer than 8 skills being listed for it (drawn from the master resume), those skills should instead be integrated into a more general, existing `\techSkillsItem` (e.g., under "Developer Tools" or a broad "Technical Skills" if no other specific category fits well) rather than creating a new, sparse `\techSkillsItem`.
- If the Soft Skills section is retained:
  - Ensure it is formatted as `\techSkillsItem{Soft Skills}{Soft Skill 1, Soft Skill 2, ..., Soft Skill N}`.
  - Prune the list of soft skills in the second argument to the 8 most relevant ones that align with the job description's emphasized soft skills or that are relevant.
