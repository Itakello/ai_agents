- Replace the `|professional title|` placeholder in the LaTeX source with a **cleaned** version of the target job title:
  - Keep **only** the core role name (e.g., `|Software Engineer|`).
  - **Remove** any location indicators (e.g., `, Multiple Locations`, city/state names).
  - **Remove** corporate program descriptors or training-track labels (e.g., `Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA)`).
  - Retain parenthetical abbreviations **only** if they clarify the role itself (e.g., `Technical Program Manager (TPM)`), not if they denote an external program or organization.
  - Example: From the job title `Software Engineer â€“ Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), Multiple Locations`, the cleaned title should be `|Software Engineer|`.
- Reduce the summary (typically within an `\introduction{...}` block) to a maximum of 3 impactful sentences, sharply focused on the job requirements.
- Project details (titles, tools, and dates) specified within `\resumeProjectHeading` commands must remain unchanged. Do not modify these elements.
- For each project, ensure the number of bullet points (items enclosed between `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd`) is between **2 and 4**, based on the project's importance; highlight critical projects with up to 4 bullets and keep less critical ones concise with 2.
- When modifying any list of items, such as project descriptions within `\resumeItemListStart`...`\resumeItemListEnd`, the SEARCH block must include the *entire original* list block, including the `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd` commands. The REPLACE block must also contain the full new list, again enclosed by `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd`. **IMPORTANT: If you are generating diffs for multiple such list blocks (e.g., for several job experiences or project entries), each modification MUST be encapsulated in its own, separate `***BEGIN_DIFF...***END_DIFF` block. Ensure that all diff markers (`>>>>>>> SEARCH`, `=======`, `<<<<<<< REPLACE`, `***BEGIN_DIFF`, `***END_DIFF`) are ONLY used as per the system prompt's strict formatting rules (each on its own line, never as part of LaTeX content) and that there is no extraneous text between a valid `***END_DIFF` of one block and the `***BEGIN_DIFF` of the next.**
- When aligning skill buckets:
  - If introducing new skill categories, use the format `\techSkillsItem{New Category Name}{Skill A, Skill B, Skill C, Skill D}`. Ensure the category name is descriptive and aligns with job description terminology if possible.
  - A maximum of two such new `\techSkillsItem` entries for distinct skill categories may be introduced. Prioritize categories explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the job description.
  - Each `\techSkillsItem` (whether existing or newly created for skills) should ideally list a minimum of 6 relevant skills in its second argument. If a newly created skill category would result in fewer than 6 skills being listed for it (drawn from the master resume), those skills should instead be integrated into a more general, existing `\techSkillsItem` (e.g., under "Developer Tools" or a broad "Technical Skills" if no other specific category fits well) rather than creating a new, sparse `\techSkillsItem`.
- If the Soft Skills section is retained:
  - Ensure it is formatted as `\techSkillsItem{Soft Skills}{Soft Skill 1, Soft Skill 2, ..., Soft Skill N}`.
