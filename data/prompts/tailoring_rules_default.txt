- Replace the `|professional title|` placeholder in the LaTeX source with the target job title. For example, if the job title is 'Software Engineer', the diff should search for `|professional title|` and replace it with `|Software Engineer|`.
- Reduce the summary (typically within an `\introduction{...}` block) to a maximum of 3 impactful sentences, sharply focused on the job requirements.
- Project details (titles, tools, and dates) specified within `\resumeProjectHeading` commands must remain unchanged. Do not modify these elements.
- For the summary section, if it's enclosed in a LaTeX command like `\introduction{...}`, ensure the SEARCH block in your diff includes the *entire* original content of the command, including the command itself and its braces (e.g., `\introduction{original summary text...}`). The REPLACE block should then contain the new `\introduction{new summary text...}`.
- When modifying any list of items, such as project descriptions within `\resumeItemListStart`...`\resumeItemListEnd`, the SEARCH block must include the *entire original* list block, including the `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd` commands. The REPLACE block must also contain the full new list, again enclosed by `\resumeItemListStart` and `\resumeItemListEnd`.
- Strive for a final resume length that fits on a single page after PDF compilation. This often means being very selective about content.
- ABSOLUTE RULE: Every skill, tool, or technology listed in any `\techSkillsItem` block MUST be explicitly present in the MASTER résumé. Do not infer or add skills based solely on the job description if they are not in the MASTER résumé.
- When aligning skill buckets:
  - If introducing new skill categories, use the format `\techSkillsItem{New Category Name}{Skill A, Skill B, Skill C, Skill D}`. Ensure the category name is descriptive and aligns with job description terminology if possible.
  - A maximum of two such new `\techSkillsItem` entries for distinct skill categories may be introduced. Prioritize categories explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the job description.
  - Each `\techSkillsItem` (whether existing or newly created for skills) should ideally list a minimum of 5 relevant skills in its second argument. If a newly created skill category would result in fewer than 5 skills being listed for it (drawn from the master resume), those skills should instead be integrated into a more general, existing `\techSkillsItem` (e.g., under "Developer Tools" or a broad "Technical Skills" if no other specific category fits well) rather than creating a new, sparse `\techSkillsItem`.
- If the Soft Skills section is retained:
  - Ensure it is formatted as `\techSkillsItem{Soft Skills}{Soft Skill 1, Soft Skill 2, ..., Soft Skill N}`.
  - Prune the list of soft skills in the second argument to the 8 most relevant ones that align with the job description's emphasized soft skills.
