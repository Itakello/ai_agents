CONTEXT FROM OVERFLOWING PAGE (PAGE 2):
---------------------------------------
This text is from page 2 of the PDF and gives an indication of the content that is causing the resume to exceed one page. Use this for context to understand the scale and type of information that might need to be condensed or removed from the *full LaTeX content below*. Do NOT assume this specific text block must be removed verbatim; the goal is to reduce the overall length of the document to one page by editing the full LaTeX.
